# Git Workflow Exercise 2: Creating a Resume

## In this exercise, you'll be working on your HTML and Git skills. You have three tasks:

[] Fork this repo, and clone it into your computer using the command line (`git clone`)
[] Create a resume in HTML. Doesn't have to be anything fancy, but we'd like it to be as complete as possible! 
[] After you're done, we want you to use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to push up your resume to github.


## Bonus:

[] Add some styling to your resume in index.css!
